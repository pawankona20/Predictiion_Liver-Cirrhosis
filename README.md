#Project Description
Revolutionizing Liver Care: Predicting Liver Cirrhosis using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques is a data-driven healthcare initiative aimed at the early detection and prognosis of liver cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis is a chronic and progressive liver disease marked by irreversible scarring of liver tissue, leading to severe health complications and potential liver failure if not addressed in time.
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze medical datasets and predict the likelihood of cirrhosis in patients based on clinical and laboratory features. By using advanced preprocessing techniques, normalization, and classification models (such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes), the system can assist medical professionals in making more accurate and timely diagnoses.
#Objectives
To build an efficient and reliable ML model for the prediction of liver cirrhosis.
To assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.
To evaluate and compare multiple ML algorithms for best performance.
To deploy the model through a user-friendly Flask web interface for real-world usability.
#Key Features
Cleaned and preprocessed liver patient dataset.
Feature normalization and handling of missing values.
Multiple ML models for comparison (Random Forest, Naive Bayes, etc.).
Accuracy evaluation and model performance visualization.
Flask-based web application with input form and prediction display.
